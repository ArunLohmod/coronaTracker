    <p>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. <br>
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
    </p>
<br><br><br>
    <h3>HOW IT SPREADS</h3>

    <p>
      The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. <br>
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
    </p>

    <br><br><br>

    <h4>Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow advice provided by your local health authority.</h4>
    
    <br><br>

    <h3>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</h3> <br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stay home if you feel unwell.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <p>Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</p>
